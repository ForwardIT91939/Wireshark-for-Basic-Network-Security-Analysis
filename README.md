Wireshark-for-Basic-Network-Security-Analysis
------------------------------------------------
This project will contain details on how to capture some network traffic that is flowing through a machine now and analyzing already captured network traffic by opening a stored capture file in Wireshark. 
It will also contain the differences between Wireshark Capture and Display Filters.
Generating, capturing analyzing RADIUS, HTTP, DNS and Telnet Traffic. It will contain Decrypting RADIUS password.
Generating, capturing analyzing encrypted protocols such as SSH and HTTPS and decrypt HTTPS Traffic.
